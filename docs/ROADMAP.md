# Implementation Roadmap

## M0 — Prototype

Focus: prove the core competitive loop.

- [x] deterministic board generator (server/internal/match + prng golden)
- [x] deterministic scoring engine (server/internal/scoring golden)
- [x] dictionary compiler + validator benchmark (server/cmd/dictcompile canonical pipeline; in-process validator benchmark; snapshots en/ru/uk canonical-locked by test)
- [x] authoritative 1v1 match simulation (waves/claims/locks/steals/replay)
- [x] WebSocket transport adapter (binary protobuf envelopes, HTTP create endpoint)
- [x] Protobuf encode/decode compatibility tests (round-trip + byte stability)
- [x] prediction/reconciliation (server convergence proven headless; Unity
  pending-intent overlay + canonical snapshot/event reconciliation shell
  added 2026-09-10; M0 criterion 3 satisfied — rejected predictions converge
  via canonical snapshots without scene reload; richer rollback animation
  remains M1 polish)
- [x] reconnect/resume (token reconnect inside grace; canonical snapshot reconciliation)
- [x] network fault simulation (RTT/loss matrix over real WebSocket)
- [x] Unity swipe prototype (delivered via B1 mitigation: runtime IMGUI gesture
  path in client/unity — drag/swipe multi-cell selection with tap toggle and
  swipe-back undo — built and smoke-tested on GitHub-hosted x86_64 Unity CI +
  hosted Android emulator; verified run 34449018045 success, 2026-09-10)

Exit gate: two remote clients can complete repeated matches with identical final state and reproducible event logs.

## M1 — Vertical Slice

- [~] production-shaped match service (resource limits, request logging,
  match result persistence, /metrics JSON + Prometheus counters,
  graceful shutdown, Docker/compose, background reaper, intent rate limiting,
  seat-token rotation + optional TTL, JSONL telemetry export, /readyz readiness/draining — 2026-09-10; Unity client lifecycle controls for /readyz, result fetch and token rotation added 2026-09-10;
  systemd-managed live deployment with crash-restart, secret env file and
  docs/M1-OPS.md runbook — 2026-09-10; versioned schema migrations with a CI
  drift gate (batch 19) and Prometheus/Grafana assets validated live and
  statically (batch 20); transport abuse hardening — snapshot seat
  credential, origin policy, body caps, per-caller mutation budget, explicit-seed
  fairness gate, HTTP timeouts — plus docs/SECURITY-REVIEW-M1.md (batch 21A);
  repo-hygiene guard in CI (batch 21C); loopback-only exposure pending the
  edge/TLS decision, and the live systemd binary still waits for promotion to
  main)
- [~] shared board UX (Unity runtime bootstrap demo added 2026-09-10; server-bound REST create + binary protobuf WebSocket snapshot/event adapter added 2026-09-10; lifecycle ready/result/token controls added 2026-09-10; pending-intent reconciliation shell added 2026-09-10; drag/swipe multi-cell selection gesture path and MATCH OVER result overlay added 2026-09-10; richer production UX pending)
- [~] Claim / Lock / Cross-Steal (Unity visual demo added 2026-09-10; Unity now sends SubmitWordIntent to the authoritative server, displays pending claims, and reconciles canonical ownership/lock snapshots; swipe gesture path with ordered selection added 2026-09-10; eight-way adjacency + bridge gesture rules and device-level swipe smoke added 2026-09-10 — batch 17E; further gesture polish pending)
- [~] combo and Sudden Death (server: combo engine golden since M0; Sudden
  Death opt-in tiebreak done 2026-09-10 — docs/M1-SUDDEN-DEATH.md; Unity demo
  presentation added 2026-09-10; server event/snapshot binding added 2026-09-10; MATCH OVER result overlay with authoritative REST record added 2026-09-10; Sudden Death tiebreak headline + client-observed decisive word added 2026-09-10 — batch 17C)
- [x] basic matchmaking (stub: poll-based FIFO pairing per language, 2026-09-09;
  Unity client Find match (queue) flow with enqueue/poll/seat-token connect
  added 2026-09-10 — batch 17A)
- [~] player profile (in-memory profiles + stats folding via player_ids done;
  durable PostgreSQL storage done 2026-09-10 — docs/M1-PERSISTENCE.md,
  WORDARENA_POSTGRES_DSN)
- [x] telemetry baseline (JSON /metrics, Prometheus text export, optional
  non-blocking JSONL lifecycle/action event sink — 2026-09-10)

## M1 exit status, measured 2026-09-10

Counts below are task-level evidence from `agent/state/current.yml` and
`agent/tasks/`, not estimates.

| M1 row | State | What is still open |
|---|---|---|
| production-shaped match service | verified live, one step from done | promote the systemd binary from `5dbcc42` to current main; Q8 edge/TLS decision |
| basic matchmaking | done | — |
| telemetry baseline | done | — |
| player profile + durable storage | done | identity/auth layer is M2 scope |
| shared board UX | in progress | richer rollback animation, production UI |
| Claim / Lock / Cross-Steal | in progress | gesture polish; device-level swipe smoke pending a stable hosted emulator (21B) |
| combo and Sudden Death | in presentation polish | nothing server-side |
| security / protocol robustness | done for M1 scope | finding S-2 (enumerable match ids) via `M1-batch21g-match-codes` |
| build + CI reliability | in progress | 21B self-heal merging; the device leg has never been green |

Verified live on 2026-09-10 against an isolated build of `c2079e8`: queue
exit gate 6/6 PASS, direct control 3/3 PASS with baseline scores
(43:45 / 37:60 / 44:40), `infra/smoke.sh` 18/18 (22/22 on main after 21A).

## Gate philosophy

A milestone is complete when its exit criteria are measurable, not when all planned code exists. Features may be cut or delayed when experiments show they do not improve player value or operational safety.
