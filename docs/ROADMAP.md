# Implementation Roadmap

## M0 — Prototype

Focus: prove the core competitive loop.

- [x] deterministic board generator (server/internal/match + prng golden)
- [x] deterministic scoring engine (server/internal/scoring golden)
- [x] dictionary compiler + validator benchmark (server/cmd/dictcompile canonical pipeline; in-process validator benchmark; snapshots en/ru/uk canonical-locked by test)
- [x] authoritative 1v1 match simulation (waves/claims/locks/steals/replay)
- [x] WebSocket transport adapter (binary protobuf envelopes, HTTP create endpoint)
- [x] Protobuf encode/decode compatibility tests (round-trip + byte stability)
- [~] prediction/reconciliation (server convergence proven headless; Unity pending-intent overlay + canonical snapshot/event reconciliation shell added 2026-09-10; richer mobile rollback animation pending)
- [x] reconnect/resume (token reconnect inside grace; canonical snapshot reconciliation)
- [x] network fault simulation (RTT/loss matrix over real WebSocket)
- [x] Unity swipe prototype (delivered via B1 mitigation: runtime IMGUI gesture
  path in client/unity — drag/swipe multi-cell selection with tap toggle and
  swipe-back undo — built and smoke-tested on GitHub-hosted x86_64 Unity CI +
  hosted Android emulator; verified run 34449018045 success, 2026-09-10)

Exit gate: two remote clients can complete repeated matches with identical final state and reproducible event logs.

## M1 — Vertical Slice

- [~] production-shaped match service (resource limits, request logging,
  match result persistence, /metrics JSON + Prometheus counters,
  graceful shutdown, Docker/compose, background reaper, intent rate limiting,
  seat-token rotation + optional TTL, JSONL telemetry export, /readyz readiness/draining — 2026-09-10; Unity client lifecycle controls for /readyz, result fetch and token rotation added 2026-09-10;
  systemd-managed live deployment with crash-restart, secret env file and
  docs/M1-OPS.md runbook — 2026-09-10; loopback-only exposure pending edge/TLS decision)
- [~] shared board UX (Unity runtime bootstrap demo added 2026-09-10; server-bound REST create + binary protobuf WebSocket snapshot/event adapter added 2026-09-10; lifecycle ready/result/token controls added 2026-09-10; pending-intent reconciliation shell added 2026-09-10; drag/swipe multi-cell selection gesture path and MATCH OVER result overlay added 2026-09-10; richer production UX pending)
- [~] Claim / Lock / Cross-Steal (Unity visual demo added 2026-09-10; Unity now sends SubmitWordIntent to the authoritative server, displays pending claims, and reconciles canonical ownership/lock snapshots; swipe gesture path with ordered selection added 2026-09-10; gesture polish pending)
- [~] combo and Sudden Death (server: combo engine golden since M0; Sudden
  Death opt-in tiebreak done 2026-09-10 — docs/M1-SUDDEN-DEATH.md; Unity demo
  presentation added 2026-09-10; server event/snapshot binding added 2026-09-10; MATCH OVER result overlay with authoritative REST record added 2026-09-10; Sudden Death result-screen polish pending)
- [x] basic matchmaking (stub: poll-based FIFO pairing per language, 2026-09-09;
  Unity client Find match (queue) flow with enqueue/poll/seat-token connect
  added 2026-09-10 — batch 17A)
- [~] player profile (in-memory profiles + stats folding via player_ids done;
  durable PostgreSQL storage done 2026-09-10 — docs/M1-PERSISTENCE.md,
  WORDARENA_POSTGRES_DSN)
- [x] telemetry baseline (JSON /metrics, Prometheus text export, optional
  non-blocking JSONL lifecycle/action event sink — 2026-09-10)

## Gate philosophy

A milestone is complete when its exit criteria are measurable, not when all planned code exists. Features may be cut or delayed when experiments show they do not improve player value or operational safety.
